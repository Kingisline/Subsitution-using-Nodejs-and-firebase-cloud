## Algorithm for Automatic Substitution

1. Data Collection: Maintain a database of teachers, their subjects, and their availability.
2. Absence Logging: When a teacher is absent, update their status.
3. Find Substitute:
    - Check teachers available in the same time slot.
    Match subject expertise.
    - If multiple substitutes exist, prioritize based on availability, workload, or seniority.
4. Notify & Update: Assign the substitute and notify both students and the substitute teacher.
